# Development Guide

This document contains implementation and contributor information for Logic
Model Builder. The main README is intentionally focused on the playable game.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # local development server
npm test           # run the test suite once
npm run test:watch # rerun tests while files change
npm run build      # type-check and create a production build
```

On Windows systems where PowerShell blocks `npm.ps1`, invoke the same scripts
through `npm.cmd`, for example `npm.cmd test`.

The logic modules do not depend on React or React Flow. Campaign and tutorial
missions are declarative data consumed by the same objective and constraint
engine used by the sandbox.

`GameLevel.objectiveKind` distinguishes normal semantic objectives from narrow
construction-only objectives. A construction level omits `formula`, `scope`,
and `targetTruth`; `validateLevelObjective` rejects ambiguous combinations.
Its normal verification path applies existing construction constraints followed
by `verifyConstructionObjective`, without invoking the formula evaluator.
`workspacePresentation` declares the focused Learn controls (`worlds`,
`valuations`, `edges`, and `evaluation`) so absent panels are not merely
disabled or keyboard-focusable. Existing semantic/custom formats remain
compatible because semantic fields and custom-file parsing are unchanged.

Home and global navigation direct newcomers to Learn. Campaigns keeps its
selected General Challenges or Practice Library section in component state.
Guided Learn HUDs keep Check task visible, hide raw technical constraints unless
authored `workspacePresentation.visibleConstraints` is present, and invalidate
the current verification result after semantic or structural edits. Historical
completion is kept separately from the current pending/success/failure attempt.

## Verification scopes

- **Pointed:** evaluates `M,w ⊨ φ` at the designated world.
- **Model-global:** evaluates `M ⊨ φ` at every world under the current valuation.
- **Frame validity:** evaluates `F ⊨ φ` at every world under every valuation.
- **Correspondence:** compares finite-frame validity with a selected relational
  property on the current frame and reports both sides separately.

Finite-frame validity enumerates valuations and is exponential in the number of
worlds and atoms. Interactive checks are capped at 65,536 valuations to prevent
impractically long work on the browser's main thread.

## Frame rules

A frame rule can be off, validated without changing the relation, or enforced
by adding derived edges. Reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, and Euclideanness
support enforcement. Seriality, irreflexivity, and acyclicity are validation-only
because repairing them can require arbitrary choices or deleting explicit data.

## Persistence

Sandbox state and mission progress are stored in browser `localStorage`. There
is currently no backend, account system, or cross-device synchronization. The
Data dialog can reset these stores independently and export or import versioned
model JSON. Imports validate formulas, world identifiers, atoms, relations, and
supported frame-rule modes before changing the sandbox.

How to Play uses `logic-game:campaign-progress:v2`. On first load it reads the
former v1 progress when necessary, preserves recognised practice and campaign
mission IDs, and intentionally drops only the obsolete semantic tutorial IDs:
they do not map safely to the six UI-control steps.

An anonymous guest profile stores a random local identifier and up to 250 recent
verification attempts. It does not use IP addresses or browser fingerprinting.
Profile backups contain history and learning progress and can be restored in a
different browser through the same Data dialog.

## Verification diagnostics

Objective verdicts include structured truth values for every world under the
relevant valuation. Failed frame-validity checks additionally expose the full
countervaluation separately from the prose explanation. Each relevant local
evaluation also returns a recursive tree containing the active subformula,
world, semantic rule, truth value, child evaluations, and focused diagnostics.
The UI renders this trace as a nested, expandable evaluation tree.

The evaluator deliberately records both Boolean children and every accessible
successor checked by `□` or `◇`, rather than retaining only the first decisive
branch. This makes the trace useful for teaching while preserving the same
truth-functional result.

## Formula-equivalence objectives

An optional `comparisonFormula` changes the configured semantic target from a
single-formula truth check to an equivalence check. Pointed equivalence compares
both truth values at the evaluation world. Model-global equivalence compares
them at every world under the displayed valuation. Frame equivalence checks the
biconditional at every world under every valuation and returns a distinguishing
countervaluation when it fails. Correspondence objectives intentionally cannot
be combined with formula equivalence.

## Solution diversity and isomorphism

Successful guided or custom missions receive a canonical finite-structure
signature in the local guest profile. Canonicalization ignores world names and
coordinates. It preserves explicit semantic relation edges and preserves
valuations for pointed/model objectives; frame and correspondence solutions
ignore the displayed valuation. Pointed objectives additionally preserve the
designated evaluation world. The current exact permutation algorithm is capped
at eight worlds, and diversity tracking is skipped—not mission verification—if
that limit is exceeded. At most 25 signatures are retained per mission.

Successful and failed attempt history also stores transparent construction
metrics: world count, distinct explicit-edge count, true `(world, atom)`
memberships, and—when a level baseline exists—the semantic-change count defined
by `maximumChanges`. These are descriptive measurements. The UI deliberately
does not collapse them into an arbitrary score or label a solution minimal.

Attempt history stores the active mission concept and a stable failure category
when verification does not complete. Current categories distinguish missing or
incorrect required answers, construction constraints, frame-rule configuration,
relational-property validation, semantic objectives, and syntax/model-data
errors. The profile aggregates successes/attempts by concept and counts these
categories locally. This is diagnostic history, not an inference about a
student's knowledge or a substitute for pedagogical assessment.

## Generated frame tests and validity cost

The generated-frame regression suite enumerates every relation on one, two, and
three worlds. It checks that each enforceable closure is extensive and actually
satisfies its property, and independently confirms the finite correspondences
T/reflexive, D/serial, B/symmetric, 4/transitive, and 5/Euclidean on every such
frame. This is deterministic exhaustive small-model testing rather than random
sampling.

The workspace previews frame-search cost as `2^(|W|·|Atoms|)` valuations using
the union of atoms in both formulas. Searches above
`DEFAULT_MAXIMUM_VALUATIONS` are disabled before execution with an explicit
message; the engine retains the same limit as a defensive invariant.

## Optional mission bonuses

A level may define `bonusConstraints` in addition to its required construction
constraints. Bonus conditions do not block completion and are not shown before
the primary objective is verified.

## Prediction interactions

A level may optionally require a prediction before verification. The current
interaction kinds ask for either the formula's truth value or a counterexample
world. Predictions do not alter the modal semantics or replace the objective;
they are compared with the structured verdict after the construction has been
evaluated. This discourages blind trial and error while keeping solution hints
out of the mission briefing.

The `frame-property` interaction presents an author-specified set of relational
properties and compares the player's answer with `expectedProperty`. With
`mustBeCorrect: true`, the semantic objective and the answer must both succeed
before completion. The expected answer remains level metadata, not an inference
silently guessed from a relation that may violate several properties at once.

The `countervaluation` interaction stores two or more complete valuations with
stable choice identifiers. Import validation requires every choice to assign an
atom list to every mission world and requires `expectedChoice` to reference one
of those choices. With `mustBeCorrect`, selecting the correct concrete
assignment is part of completion rather than optional prediction feedback.

The `model-choice` interaction stores two or more self-contained finite pointed
models. Each candidate has its own worlds, atom lists, explicit relation, and
evaluation world. Import validation is independent for every candidate, so a
candidate cannot reference worlds from either the playable level or another
choice. The expected choice is authored explicitly because the prompt may ask
about any supported semantic property, not only the level's primary formula.

## Custom mission files

Custom missions use the versioned `logic-model-builder-level` JSON format. The
authoring workflow captures two independent workspace snapshots: the initial
state delivered to the player and, optionally, a reference solution. Before the
solution is stored, the engine checks the objective, construction constraints,
required frame-rule modes, and active relational rules. Importing a mission
loads only the initial state; the solution is metadata and is never applied to
the player workspace. Because JSON is inspectable, it should not be treated as
secret or tamper-proof answer storage.

`Playtest as player` validates the same serialized package used for download,
then launches its initial snapshot through the normal custom-mission loader.
Leaving the playtest restores the author workspace. `Restore captured start`
is intentionally destructive and therefore asks for confirmation.

The editor also captures the author-facing title, instruction and learning
objective, plus the parts a player may edit. Authors can set world and
edge bounds, required or forbidden frame properties, a prediction interaction,
required or forbidden edges and atom assignments, and an optional maximum-edge
bonus. Edge constraints use `source -> target`; atom constraints use
`world: p q`, with commas, semicolons, or new lines separating entries where
appropriate. Imports validate the formula, semantic
scope, worlds, relation, evaluation world, frame rules, correspondence preset,
constraints, prediction, bonus, and edit permissions before opening the mission.

The editor rejects constraints that require and forbid the same edge, atom, or
frame property before a mission file is exported or launched.

## Custom campaign packages

The versioned `logic-model-builder-campaign` format contains an ordered list of
complete `logic-model-builder-level` files, so each mission retains its own
constraints and optional reference solution. Import validates every nested
mission and rejects duplicate mission ids before launching the package as one
custom sequence. The Data dialog can collect the currently authored mission,
remove collected entries, and download the ordered package. Package metadata is
descriptive; progress continues to be keyed by the nested mission ids.

## Share URLs

Mission and campaign JSON can be UTF-8 encoded as URL-safe Base64 in the
`#share=` fragment. Browsers do not send fragments in HTTP requests, so the
payload remains client-side and requires no storage backend. On initial load,
the app decodes and runs the same versioned parser used by pasted JSON before
launching the shared sequence. Payloads above 60,000 encoded characters are
rejected with a recommendation to use the downloadable file, since practical
URL limits vary across browsers and messaging services.

`maximumChanges` is a baseline-relative construction constraint. It counts the
symmetric differences in world identifiers, distinct explicit relation pairs,
and `(world, atom)` memberships. Coordinates are presentation data and never
count as semantic changes. This deliberately describes a semantic edit budget,
not mouse clicks or undo-history entries.

## Local educator export

The Profile screen can export its last 250 locally stored attempts as CSV. Each
row includes the pseudonymous guest id, mission and scope, outcome, diagnostic
category, model size, semantic-change count, and optional bonus result. Authored
text is quoted and values beginning with spreadsheet formula characters are
prefixed with an apostrophe to avoid CSV formula injection.

This is deliberately a browser-local hand-off, not telemetry or an account
system. There is no backend, IP-based identity, automatic collection, or
cross-device synchronization; the player decides whether to share the file.

Semantic failures are classified from the structured verdict and evaluation
trace rather than from rendered prose. Categories distinguish a target reached
at the wrong pointed world, missing or unwanted diamond witnesses, boxed
counterexample successors, vacuous box truth, model-global counterexamples,
frame countervaluations, all-valuations confusion, and correspondence mismatch.

## Current technical scope

The project works with explicit finite frames. It does not currently include an
external solver, proof of model minimality, or a formal notation
for regular infinite frames. These are possible extensions rather than hidden
requirements of the existing engine.

The production build separates React, React Flow, and application code into
cacheable chunks. This keeps each initial JavaScript asset below the configured
500 kB warning threshold while retaining relative URLs for GitHub Pages.

The application shell keeps the global header outside the main landmark and
provides a keyboard-visible skip link. Interactive controls share a high-contrast
focus-visible treatment, result changes are exposed as atomic live regions, and
the existing reduced-motion media query suppresses non-essential transitions.

Fullscreen is an optional progressive enhancement using the browser Fullscreen
API. The toolbar control is disabled where the API is unavailable or forbidden;
the game remains fully usable in the normal browser viewport.

## Interface hierarchy

The workspace is styled as one visual workbench rather than five equally weighted
cards. The graph is the primary surface, editing panels use quieter elevation,
and verification closes the left-to-right task flow with a petrol accent. Global
navigation uses a compact segmented treatment; destructive and negative states
reserve the brown accent. Short entrance and result transitions clarify state
changes and are disabled by the reduced-motion preference.

The initial app view is a concise home menu. The top-level destinations are
Home, Campaigns, Sandbox, Create, Modal Logic Guide, and Profile. Campaigns
contains four roles: the short How to Play tutorial entry, Intro to Modal Logic
(presented by the internal Learn engine), General Challenges, and the non-linear
Practice Library. Introductory structural missions use ordinary `GameLevel`
constraints (exact worlds and required/forbidden edges) together with the same
deterministic evaluator as semantic missions; no second workspace exists. Shared
URL fragments remain direct navigation instructions and therefore launch the
validated custom mission or campaign without stopping at Home. Interface
settings are versioned separately from sandbox and learning data.

Guided workspaces keep the graph tall by rendering only mission identity,
objective, constraints, and level navigation in the persistent HUD. Briefings
and learning objectives live in the expandable `Level details` popover. Desktop
sidebars are deliberately narrower than the graph and can still be collapsed.
